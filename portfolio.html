    <p>Academic Decathlon is a ten-event academic competition for teams of high school students. You 
	compete in all the different subjects of Music, Math, Art, Science, Social Science, Literature, and
	Economics, as well as the subjective events of Speech, Interview, and Essay! It's an incredible way to
	meet new people, as well as learn about things you've never even thought of before.</p>
	
	<p>For instance, music. For most people who aren't musically inclined, there would be no reason to 
	seriously research it, or learn about it in school. But in Academic Decathlon, you can go in depth as 
	much as you want, and the topics themselves change every year- each year, there is a different overarching 
	theme to tie all the subjects together. This year was the continent of Africa. Last year was World War II. 
	And next year will be the time period of the 1960's in America. With the range of topics and subjects,
	you can learn and think about an incredible amount of new information.</p>
	
	<p>How to join is simple: if you're in any of the 49 states except for California, don't join because
	your local programs will be crap.</p>
	
	<p>If you ARE in California, then also don't join. I live in California and I don't need the extra competition, 
	so just stay out before I kick you out.</p>
	
	<p>In conclusion, don't join Acadec. Bye.</p>
